The CounterKnight is a hyper casual action game, players have to block arrows and defeat enemies in order to make good score. It's an endless game but when you kill a wave boss, waves are getting harder by increasing enemies' spawn and attack speed. After 3 waves later, the game will be in hardest mode. Additionally, the game has TR(Turkish) and EN(English) language options.
